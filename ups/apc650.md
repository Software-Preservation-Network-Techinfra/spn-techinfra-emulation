# APC UPS 650VA Battery

[[toc]]


## Does it Beep?

Yes. Whenever it kicks in, which can be when you lose power (acceptable), or whenever the voltage from the outlet fluctuates out of a narrow range (awful, unacceptable, never wanted to think this much about my home wiring).

## Can you make it stop?

Yes -- you need to connect to it via USB (which I'd never done otherwise), install the software, and in there you can find a toggle.
