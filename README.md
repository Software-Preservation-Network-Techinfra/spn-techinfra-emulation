# SPN Technical Infrastructure Group Emulation Resource

This is the source for the SPN Technical Infrastructure group's community resource for emulation use cases. The layout is currently borrowed from the source of [doesitbeep.com](https://doesitbeep.com), which in turn borrows from [docs.shutter.sh](https://docs.shutter.sh/). This may change.

## Development

First, install the dependencies, as usual (you need npm for this; refer to your platform-specific documentation to install):

```sh
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, install 11ty globally, and use it to serve the site:

`npm i -g @11ty/eleventy`

`eleventy`
`eleventy --serve`


## Contributing

Create a pull request. The repository will soon be linked to [netlify](https://netlify.com/), which will automatically add your contribution to the site when the pull request is merged into the `main` branch.
