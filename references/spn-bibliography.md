# SPN Bibliography

The Software Preservation Network's Teaching and Education Working Group maintains a Zotero bibliography of software preservation and emulation resources. 

The emulation references are managed by Ethan Gates for the Emulation as a Service Infrastructure (EaaSI) Project. 

All references mentioned in this resource can be found in the SPN Bibliography "Emulation" folder.
